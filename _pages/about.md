About Me
======
Hi, welcome to my website!

I am a third-year Ph.D. student at Unitrento RSLab, working with Prof. Lorenzo Bruzzone and Prof. Stefano Vitale. 
My main research interests lie in the Representation Learning and Anomoly Detection in RS data and GW data.

Prior to Unitrento, I completed my M.Phil degree at UCAS, advised by Prof. Liming Jiang and Prof. Hansheng Wang. I did my undergraduate study at Shandong University.

Updates
